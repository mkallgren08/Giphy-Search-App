# Giphy-Search-App

Have some fun looking for cute, random, or just plain fun gifs using [this app](https://mkallgren08.github.io/Giphy-Search-App/).
One you're on the main page:
  1. Select the number of gifs you'd like to find using the dropdown button in the upper-right corner 
  1. Press any of the purple tag-buttons in the upper left-hand corner to search for that button's gifs!
      1. **Or:** Enter a new tag to search for, hit submit and then click the newly made tag-button!

**Credits:** Gif search functionality powered by the folks at [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI).
